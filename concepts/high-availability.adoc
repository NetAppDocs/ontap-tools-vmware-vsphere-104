[.lead]
ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere supports a high-availability (HA) configuration to help provide uninterrupted functionality of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere during failure.

High-availability (HA) solution provides for rapid recovery from outages caused by:

* Host failure
+
[NOTE]
Only single-node failure is supported.
* Network failure
* Virtual machine failure (Guest OS failure)
* Application (ONTAP tools) crash

No additional configuration is required for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to provide high availability (HA).

[NOTE]
ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere does not support vCenter HA.

To enable the HA feature, the CPU hot add and memory hot plug should be enabled during deployment or later in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere VM settings.
