You can configure Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) by using the Array Manager wizard of VMware Live Site Recovery to enable interactions between VMware Live Site Recovery and storage virtual machines (SVMs).

.Before you begin

* You should have paired the protected sites and recovery sites in VMware Live Site Recovery.
* You should have configured your onboarded storage before configuring the array manager.
* You should have configured and replicated the SnapMirror relationships between the protected sites and recovery sites.
* You should have enabled the SVM management LIFs to enable multitenancy.

SRA supports cluster-level management and SVM-level management. If you add storage at a cluster level, then you can discover and perform operations on all the SVMs in the cluster. If you add storage at an SVM level, then you can manage only that specific SVM.

.Steps

. In VMware Live Site Recovery, select *Array Managers* > *Add Array Manager*.
. Enter the following information to describe the array in VMware Live Site Recovery:
.. Enter a name to identify the array manager in the *Display Name* field.
.. In the *SRA Type* field, select *NetApp Storage Replication Adapter for ONTAP*.
.. Enter the information to connect to the cluster or the SVM:
*** If you are connecting to a cluster, you should enter the cluster management LIF.
*** If you are connecting directly to an SVM, you should enter the IP address of the SVM management LIF.
+
NOTE: When configuring the array manager, you should use the same connection (IP address) for the storage system that was used to onboard the storage system in ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.
For example, if the array manager configuration is SVM scoped, then the storage under ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere should be added at SVM level.
.. If connecting to a cluster, specify the SVM name in the *SVM name* field, or leave it blank to manage all SVMs in the cluster.
.. Enter the volumes to be discovered in the *Volume include list* field.
+
You can enter the source volume at the protected site and the replicated destination volume at the recovery site.
+
For example, if you want to discover volume src_vol1 that is in a SnapMirror relationship with volume dst_vol1, you should specify src_vol1 in the protected site field and dst_vol1 in the recovery site field.

 .. *(Optional)* Enter the volumes to be excluded from discovery in the *Volume exclude list* field.
+
You can enter the source volume at the protected site and the replicated destination volume at the recovery site.
+
For example, if you want to exclude volume _src_vol1_ that is in a SnapMirror relationship with volume _dst_vol1_, you should specify _src_vol1_ in the protected site field and _dst_vol1_ in the recovery site field.
. Select *Next*.
. Verify that the array is discovered and displayed at the bottom of the Add Array Manager window and select *Finish*.

You can follow the same steps for the recovery site by using the appropriate SVM management IP addresses and credentials. On the Enable Array Pairs screen of the Add Array Manager wizard, you should verify that the correct array pair is selected, and that it shows as ready to be enabled.
