You should configure the storage timeout intervals per the recommended settings for Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) to perform optimally in highly scaled environments.

== Storage Provider settings

You should set the following timeout values on VMware Live Site Recovery for scaled environment:

|===
| *Advanced settings*| *Timeout values*
a|
`StorageProvider.resignatureTimeout`
a|
Increase the value of the setting from 900 seconds to 12000 seconds.
a|
`storageProvider.hostRescanDelaySec`
a|
60
a|
`storageProvider.hostRescanRepeatCnt`
a|
20
a|
`storageProvider.hostRescanTimeoutSec`
a|
Set a high value (For example: 99999)
|===
You should also enable the `StorageProvider.autoResignatureMode` option.

== Storage settings

When you hit a timeout, increase the values of `storage.commandTimeout` and `storage.maxConcurrentCommandCnt` to a higher value.

NOTE: The timeout interval specified is the maximum value. You do not need to wait for the maximum timeout to be reached. Most commands finish within the set maximum timeout interval.
