You should create protection groups to protect a group of virtual machines on the protected site.

When you add a new datastore, you can include it in the existing datastore group or add a new datastore and create a new volume or consistency group for protection. After adding a new datastore to a protected consistency group or volume, update SnapMirror and perform storage discovery on both the protected and recovery sites. You can run discovery manually or on a schedule to ensure the new datastore is detected and protected.
// JIRA update: OTVDOC-285 and OTVDOC-286

== Pair protected and recovery sites

You should pair the protected and recovery sites created using your vSphere Client to enable Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) to discover the storage systems.

// note added for 10.4
[NOTE]
Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) supports fan-out with one sync relationship of type Automated Failover Duplex and async relationship SnapMirror on consistency group. However, fan-out with two async SnapMirror on consistency group or fan-out SnapMirrors on Volume is not supported. 

.Before you begin

* You should have VMware Live Site Recovery installed on the protected and recovery sites.
* You should have SRA installed on the protected and recovery sites.

.Steps

. Double-click *Site Recovery* on the vSphere Client home page and select *Sites*.
. Select *Objects* > *Actions* > *Pair Sites*.
. In the *Pair Site Recovery Manager Servers* dialog box, enter the address of the protected site's Platform Services Controller, and then select *Next*.
. In the Select vCenter Server section, do the following:
.. Verify that the protected site's vCenter Server appears as a matching candidate to pair.
.. Enter the SSO administrative credentials, and then select *Finish*.
. If prompted, select *Yes* to accept the security certificates.

.Result

Both the protected and recovery sites will appear in the Objects dialog box.

== Configure protection groups

.Before you begin

You should ensure that both the source and target sites are configured for the following:

* Same version of VMware Live Site Recovery installed
* Virtual machines
* Paired protected and recovery sites
* Source and destination datastores should be mounted on respective sites

.Steps

. Log in to vCenter Server and select *Site Recovery* > *Protection Groups*.
. In the *Protection Groups* pane, select *New*.
. Specify a name and description for the protection group, direction and select *Next*.
. In the *Type* field, select the *Type field option...* as datastore groups (array-based replication) for NFS and VMFS datastore. The fault domain is nothing but SVMs with replication enabled. The SVMs that have only peering implemented and have no issues are displayed.
. In the Replication groups tab, select either the enabled array pair or the replication groups that have the virtual machine you configured, and then select *Next*.
+
All the virtual machines on the replication group are added to the protection group.
. You can select either the existing recovery plan or create a new one by selecting *Add to new recovery plan.*
. In the Ready to complete tab, review the details of the protection group that you created, and then select *Finish*.
