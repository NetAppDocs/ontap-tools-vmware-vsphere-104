Ensure the following requirements are met before you proceed with the deployment:
|===
|Requirements|Your status

|vSphere version, ONTAP version, and ESXi host version are compatible with the ONTP tools version.|❏ Yes ❏ No
|vCenter Server environment is set up and configured|❏ Yes ❏ No
|Browser cache is deleted|❏ Yes ❏ No
|You have the parent vCenter Server credentials|❏ Yes ❏ No
|You have the login credentials for the vCenter Server instance, to which the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere will connect post-deployment for registration|❏ Yes ❏ No
|The domain name on which the certificate is issued is mapped to the virtual IP address in a multi-vCenter deployment where custom CA certificates are mandatory. |❏ Yes ❏ No
|You have run the nslookup check on the domain name to check if the domain is getting resolved to the intended IP address.|❏ Yes ❏ No
|The certificate is created with the domain name and the ONTAP tools IP address.|❏ Yes ❏ No
|ONTAP tools application and internal services are reachable from the vCenter Server.|❏ Yes ❏ No
|When using multi-tenant SVMs, you have an SVM management LIF on each SVM.|❏ Yes ❏ No

== Deployment worksheet
=== For single node deployment
Use the following worksheet to gather the required information for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere initial deployment:

|===
|Requirement|Your value

|IP address for the ONTAP tools application. This is the IP address for accessing the ONTAP tools web interface|
|ONTAP tools virtual IP address for internal communication. This IP address is used for internal communication in a setup with multiple ONTAP tools instances. This IP address should not be same as the IP address for the ONTAP tools application.|
|DNS hostname for the first node|
|Primary DNS server|
|Secondary DNS server|
|DNS search domain|
|IPv4 address for the first node. It is a unique IPv4 address for the node management interface on the management network.|
|Subnet mask for the IPv4 address|
|Default gateway for the IPv4 address|
|IPv6 address (optional) |
|IPv6 prefix length (optional) |
|Gateway for the IPv6 address (optional) |

|===

[NOTE]
Create DNS records for all the above IP addresses. Before assigning hostnames, map them to the free IP addresses on the DNS. All IP addresses should be on the same VLAN selected for deployment.

=== For High availability (HA) deployment
In addition to the single node deployment requirements, you'll need the following information for HA deployment:
|===
|Requirement|Your value
|Primary DNS server|
|Secondary DNS server|
|DNS search domain|
|DNS hostname for the second node|
|IP address for the second node|
|DNS hostname for the third node|
|IP address for the third node|
|===

== Network firewall configuration
Open the required ports for the IP addresses in your network firewall. ONTAP tools must be able to reach this LIF through port 443. Refer to link:../deploy/prerequisites.html[Port requirements] for latest updates.

== ONTAP storage settings
To ensure seamless integration of ONTAP storage with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, consider the following settings:

* If you are using the Fibre Channel (FC) for storage connectivity, configure the zoning on your FC switches to connect the ESXi hosts with the SVM's FC LIFs. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-config/fibre-channel-fcoe-zoning-concept.html[Learn about FC and FCoE zoning with ONTAP systems]
* To use ONTAP tools-managed SnapMirror replication, the ONTAP storage administrator should create https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/peering/create-cluster-relationship-93-later-task.html[ONTAP cluster peer relationships] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/peering/create-intercluster-svm-peer-relationship-93-later-task.html[ONTAP intercluster SVM peer relationships] in ONTAP before using SnapMirror.
