The ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere appliance is deployed as small-sized single node with core services to support NFS and VMFS datastores. The ONTAP tools deployment process might take up to 45 minutes.

.Before you begin

A content library in VMware is a container object which stores VM templates, vApp templates, and other types of files. Deployment with content library provides you with a seamless experience because it is not dependent on the network connectivity.
[NOTE]
You should store the content library on a shared datastore so that all hosts within a cluster can access it.
Create a content library to store the OVA before configuring the appliance to HA configuration. Do not delete the content library template after deployment.

[NOTE]
To enable HA deployment later, do not deploy the virtual machine hosting the ONTAP tools directly on an ESXi host. Deploy it on a cluster or resource pool instead.

If you don't have a content library, follow these steps to create one:

*Create content library*
In you plan to use only a small single node deployment, creating a content library is not necessary.

. Download the file that contains the binaries (_.ova_) and signed certificates for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv10/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. Log in to the vSphere client
. Select the vSphere client menu and select *Content libraries*.
. Select *Create* on the right of the page.
. Provide a name for the library and create the content library.
. Navigate to the content library you created.
. Select *Actions* in the right of the page and select *Import item* and import the OVA file.

[NOTE]
For more information, refer to https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/01/creating-and-using-content-library.html[Creating and Using Content Library] blog.

[NOTE]
Before proceeding with the deployment, set the cluster's Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) on the inventory to 'Conservative'. This ensures that VMs are not migrated during the installation.

The ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere is initially deployed as a non-HA setup. To scale to HA deployment, you will need to enable the CPU hot plug and memory hot plugin. You can perform this step as part of the deployment process or edit the VM settings after deployment.

.Steps

. Download the file that contains the binaries (_.ova_) and signed certificates for the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv10/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^]. If you have imported the OVA into the content library, you can skip this step and proceed with the next step.
// updated for GITHUB issue 96
. Log in to the vSphere server.
. Navigate to the resource pool, cluster, or host where you intend to deploy the OVA.
+
[NOTE]
Never store ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere virtual machine on vVols datastores that it manages.
. You can deploy the OVA from the content library or from the local system.
+
|===
|From the local system|From the content library
|
a. Right-click and select *Deploy OVF template...*.

b. Choose the OVA file from the URL or browse to its location, then select *Next*.
|
a. Go to your content library and select the library item that you want to deploy. 

b. Select *Actions* > *New VM from this template*
|===
. In the *Select a name and folder* field, enter the virtual machine name and choose its location. 
+
* If you're using the vCenter Server 8.0.3 version, Select the option *Customize this virtual machine's hardware*, which will activate an additional step called *Customize hardware* before proceeding to the *Ready to complete* window.
* If you're using the vCenter Server 7.0.3 version, follow the steps in the *what's next?* section at the end of deployment.

. Select a computer resource and select *Next*. Optionally, check the box to *Automatically power on deployed VM*.
. Review the details of the template and select *Next*.
. Read and accept the license agreement and select *Next*.
. Select the storage for the configuration and the disk format and select *Next*.
. Select the destination network for each source network and select *Next*.
. In the *Customize template* window, fill in the required fields and select *Next*.

[NOTE] 
+
* The information is validated during installation. If there is a discrepancy, an error message appears on the web console, and you are prompted to correct it.
* Host names must include letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and hyphens (-). To configure dual stack, specify the host name mapped to the IPv6 address.
[NOTE]
Pure IPv6 is not supported. Mixed mode is supported with VLAN containing both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.
* ONTAP tools IP address is the primary interface for communicating with ONTAP tools.
* IPv4 is the IP address component of the node configuration, which can be utilized to enable diagnostic shell and SSH access on the node for the purposes of debugging and maintenance.
// update for OTVDOC-262 
. When using the vCenter Server 8.0.3 version, in the *Customize hardware* window, enable the *CPU hot add* and *Memory hot plug* options to allow HA functionality.
// Applicable only to vCenter 8.0.3
image:../media/customize-hw.png[Customize hardware]
. Review the details in the *Ready to complete* window, select *Finish*.
+
As the deployment task gets created, the progress is shown in the vSphere task bar.
// we might need to add another step to To customizet he hardware. go to vSphere clinet menu >  in the inventory navigate to your VM > edit settings. 
. Power on the VM after completing the task if the option to automatically power on the VM was not selected.

You can track the progress of the installation within the VM's web console.

If there are discrepancies in the OVF form, a dialog box will prompt corrective action. Use the tab button to navigate, make the necessary changes, and select *OK*. You have three attempts to resolve any issues. If problems continue after three attempts, the installation process will stop, and it is advised to retry the installation on a new virtual machine.

.Whatâ€™s next?

If you have deployment ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere with vCenter Server 7.0.3, then follow these steps after the deployment.

. Log in to the vCenter client
. Power down the ONTAP tools node.
. Navigate to the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere virtual machine under *Inventories* and select the *Edit settings* option.
. Under the *CPU* options, check the *Enable CPU hot add* checkbox
. Under the *Memory* options, check the *Enable* checkbox against *Memory hot plug*.
