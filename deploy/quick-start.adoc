[.lead]
Set up ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere with this quick start section.

Initially, you’ll deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere as a small-sized single node configuration that provides core services to support NFS and VMFS datastores. If you need to expand your configuration to use vVols datastores and high availability (HA), you’ll do so after you finish this workflow. For more information, refer to the link:../deploy/ha-workflow.html[HA deployment workflow].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Verify that your vSphere, ONTAP, and ESXi host versions are compatible with the ONTAP tools version. Allocate sufficient CPU, memory, and disk space. Based on your security rules, you might need to set up firewalls or other security tools to allow network traffic.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure the vCenter Server is installed and accessible.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Initially, you'll deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere as a small-sized single node configuration that provides core services to support NFS and VMFS datastores.
If you plan to expand your configuration to use vVols datastores and high availability (HA), you’ll do so after you finish this workflow. To expand to an HA setup, make sure CPU hot-add and memory hot-plug are enabled.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Add vCenter Server instances
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add vCenter Server instances to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to configure, manage, and protect virtual datastores in the vCenter Server environment.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Configure ONTAP user roles and privileges
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Configure new user roles and privileges for managing storage backends using the JSON file provided with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Configure the storage backends
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add a storage backend to an ONTAP cluster. For multitenancy setups where vCenter acts as the tenant with an associated SVM, use ONTAP tools Manager to add the cluster. Associate the storage backend with the vCenter Server to map it globally to the onboarded vCenter Server instance.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add the local storage backends with cluster or SVM credentials using the ONTAP tools user interface. These storage backends are limited to a single vCenter. When using cluster credentials locally, the associated SVMs automatically map to the vCenter to manage vVols or VMFS. For VMFS management, including SRA, ONTAP tools supports SVM credentials without needing a global cluster.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When working with multiple vCenter Server instances, upgrade the self-signed certificate to a certificate authority (CA) signed certificate.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Enable the SRA capability to configure disaster recovery and protect NFS or VMFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-8.png[eight] (Optional) Enable SnapMirror active sync protection
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Configure ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to manage host cluster protection for SnapMirror active sync. Perform the ONTAP cluster and SVM peering in ONTAP systems to use SnapMirror active sync. This applies only to VMFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-9.png[Nine] Set up backup and recovery for your ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere deployment
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Schedule backups of your ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere setup that you can use to recover the setup in case of a failure.
