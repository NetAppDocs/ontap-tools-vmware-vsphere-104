[.lead]
Before deploying the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, you should be familiar with the space requirements for the deployment package and some basic host system requirements.

You can use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere with VMware vCenter Server Virtual Appliance (vCSA). You should deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere on a supported vSphere client that includes ESXi system.

== System requirements

* *Installation package space requirements per node*
** 15 GB for thin provisioned installations
** 348 GB for thick provisioned installations

* *Host system sizing requirements*
Recommended memory as per the size of deployment is as shown in the table below. To deploy high availability (HA), you will require three times the appliance size specified in the table.
// updated for GITHUB issue #50
|===

|*Type of deployment*| *CPUs per node* |*Memory (GB) per node* |*Disk space (GB) thick provisioned per node*
|Small
|9
|18
|350
|Medium
|13
|26
|350
|Large

NOTE: The large deployment is only for HA configuration.
|17
|34
|350
|===
[NOTE]
When backup is enabled, each ONTAP tools cluster needs another 50 GB of space on the datastore where VMs are deployed. Therefore, non-HA requires 400 GB, and HA requires 1100 GB of space in total.

// updated note for OTVDOC-258
== Minimum storage and application requirements

|===
|Storage, host, and applications|Version requirements

|ONTAP

//OTVDOC-282 updates -Jani

|vCenter Server to deploy ONTAP tools virtual machine
|7.0 and 8.0
// updated the requirements as per OTVDOC-258
|===
[NOTE]
Beginning with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.4, the virtual machine hardware is changed from version 10 to 17.

The Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) contains the latest information about the supported versions of ONTAP, vCenter Server, ESXi hosts, and plug-in applications.

== Port requirements

The following table outlines the network ports that NetApp uses and their purposes. Ensure these ports are open and accessible to facilitate proper operation and communication within the system. Ensure that the necessary network configurations are in place to allow traffic on these ports for the associated services to function correctly. Depending on your security policies, you might need to configure firewalls or other security appliances to permit this traffic within your network.

== Configuration limits to deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

You can use the following table as a guide to configure ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.
|===

|*Deployment* | *Type* | *Number of vVols* |*Number of hosts*
