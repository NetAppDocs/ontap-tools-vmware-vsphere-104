[.lead]
Before deploying the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, you should be familiar with the space requirements for the deployment package and some basic host system requirements.

You can use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere with VMware vCenter Server Virtual Appliance (vCSA). You should deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere on a supported vSphere client that includes ESXi system.

== System requirements

* *Installation package space requirements per node*
** 15 GB for thin provisioned installations
** 348 GB for thick provisioned installations

* *Host system sizing requirements*
Recommended memory as per the size of deployment is as shown in the table below. To deploy high availability (HA), you will require three times the appliance size specified in the table.
// updated for GITHUB issue #50
|===

|*Type of deployment*| *CPUs per node* |*Memory (GB) per node* |*Disk space (GB) thick provisioned per node*
|Small
|9
|18
|350
|Medium
|13
|26
|350
|Large

NOTE: The large deployment is only for HA configuration.

|34
|350
|===
[NOTE]
When backup is enabled, each ONTAP tools cluster needs another 50 GB of space on the datastore where VMs are deployed. Therefore, non-HA requires 400 GB, and HA requires 1100 GB of space in total.

// updated note for OTVDOC-258
== Minimum storage and application requirements

|===
|Storage, host, and applications|Version requirements

|ONTAP
|9.14.1, 9.15.1, 9.16.0, 9.16.1, and 9.16.1P3

FAS, ASA A-Series, ASA C-Series, AFF A-Series, AFF C-Series, and ASA r2.

|ONTAP tools supported ESXi hosts
|7.0.3 onwards

|ONTAP tools supported vCenter Server
|7.0U3 onwards

|VASA Provider 
|3.0

|OVA Application 
|10.4

|ESXi host to deploy ONTAP tools virtual machine
|7.0U3 and 8.0U3
//OTVDOC-282 updates -Jani

|vCenter Server to deploy ONTAP tools virtual machine
|7.0 and 8.0
// updated the requirements as per OTVDOC-258
|===
[NOTE]
Beginning with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.4, the virtual machine hardware is changed from version 10 to 17.

The Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) contains the latest information about the supported versions of ONTAP, vCenter Server, ESXi hosts, and plug-in applications.

== Port requirements

The following table outlines the network ports that NetApp uses and their purposes. 
There are three different types of ports:

* External ports: These ports are accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster or node. They allow services to communicate with external networks or users, enabling integration with systems outside the cluster environment.
* Inter-node ports: These ports enable communication between nodes within the Kubernetes cluster. They are needed for cluster tasks like sharing data and working together. For single-node deployments, inter-node ports are used only within the node and do not need external access. Inter-node ports can accept traffic from outside the cluster. Block inter-node ports from internet access with firewall rules.
* Internal ports: These ports communicate within the Kubernetes cluster using ClusterIP addresses. They are not exposed externally and do not need to be added to firewall rules.

[NOTE]
Ensure that all ONTAP tools nodes reside on the same subnet to maintain uninterrupted communication with each other.

[NOTE]
For HA deployments, ensure UDP port 8472 is open between all nodes. This port enables pod-to-pod communication across nodes; blocking it will interrupt inter-node networking.
