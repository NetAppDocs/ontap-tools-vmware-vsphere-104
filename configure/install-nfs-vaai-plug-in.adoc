[.lead]
The NFS vStorage API for Array Integration (NFS VAAI) plug-in is a software component that integrates VMware vSphere and NFS storage arrays. 
Install the NFS VAAI plug-in using ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to leverage the advanced capabilities of your NFS storage array to offload certain storage-related operations from the ESXi hosts to the storage array itself.

.Before you begin

* Download the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/nfsplugin-vmware-vaai/downloads-tab[NetApp NFS Plug-in for VMware VAAI] installation package.
* Make sure you have the ESXi host and vSphere 7.0U3 latest patch or later versions and ONTAP 9.14.1 or later versions.  
* Mount an NFS datastore.

.Steps

. Log in to the vSphere client.
. Select *Shortcuts* > *NetApp ONTAP tools* under the plug-ins section.
. Select *Settings* > *NFS VAAI Tools*.
. When the VAAI plug-in is uploaded to vCenter Server, select *Change* in the *Existing version* section. If a VAAI plug-in is not uploaded to the vCenter Server, select *Upload* button.
. Browse and select the `.vib` file and select *Upload* to upload the file to ONTAP tools.
. Select *Install on ESXI host*, select the ESXi host on which you want to install the NFS VAAI plug-in, and then select *Install*.
+
Only the ESXi hosts eligible for the plug-in installation are displayed. You can monitor the installation progress in the recent tasks section of the vSphere Web Client.
. Restart the ESXi host manually after installation.
+
When the VMware admin restarts the ESXi host, ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere automatically detects and enables the NFS VAAI plug-in.

.What's next?

After youâ€™ve installed the NFS VAAI plug-in and rebooted your ESXi host,  you need to configure the correct NFS export policies for VAAI copy offload. When configuring VAAI in a NFS environment, configure the export policy rules with the following requirements in mind:

* The relevant ONTAP volume needs to allow NFSv4 calls.
* The root user should remain as root and NFSv4 should be allowed in all junction parent volumes.
* The option for VAAI support needs to be set on the relevant NFS server.
