If you've not configured the network access, all the discovered IP addresses from the ESXi host are added to the export policy by default. You can configure it to add a few specific IP addresses to the export policy and exclude the rest. However, when you perform a mount operation on the excluded ESXi hosts, the operation fails.

. Select *NetApp ONTAP tools* in the shortcuts page under the plug-ins section.
. In the left pane of ONTAP tools, navigate to *Settings* > *Manage Network Access* > *Edit*.

To add multiple IP addresses, separate the list with commas, range, Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), or a combination of all three.
. Select *Save*.
