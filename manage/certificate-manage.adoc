A self-signed certificate is generated for ONTAP tools and VASA Provider by default during deployment. Using the ONTAP tools Manager interface, you can renew the certificate or upgrade it to a custom CA.
Custom CA certificates are mandatory in a multi-vCenter deployment.


.Before you begin

* The domain name on which the certificate is issued should be mapped to the virtual IP address. 
* Run the nslookup check on the domain name to check if the domain is getting resolved to the intended IP address.  
* The certificates should be created with the domain name and the ONTAP tools IP address.

[NOTE]
A ONTAP tools IP address should map to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Certificates should contain the same FQDN mapped to the ONTAP tools IP address in subject or subject alternative names.

[NOTE]
You cannot switch from a CA-signed to a self-signed certificate.
