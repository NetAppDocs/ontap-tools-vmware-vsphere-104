. Log in with the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere administrator credentials you provided during deployment. 
. Select *Settings* from the sidebar.
. Select the *Settings* > *Telemetry* > *Edit* option.
. Enter a valid *Proxy URL* and save the changes.

If you disable AutoSupport, the proxy URL is also disabled.
