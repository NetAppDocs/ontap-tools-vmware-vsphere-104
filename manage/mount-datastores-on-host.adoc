Mounting a datastore provides storage access to additional hosts. You can mount the datastore on the additional hosts after you add the hosts to your VMware environment. 

.About this task 

* Some right-click actions are disabled or unavailable depending on the vSphere client version and the type of datastore selected. 
** If you're using vSphere client 8.0 or later versions, some of the right-click options are hidden. 
** From vSphere 7.0U3 to vSphere 8.0 versions, even though the options appear, the action will be disabled.
* The mount datastore option is disabled when the host cluster is protected with uniform configurations. 

.Steps

. From the vSphere Client home page, select *Hosts and Clusters*.
. In the left navigation pane, select the data centers containing the hosts.
. To mount NFS/VMFS datastores on host or host cluster, right-click and select *NetApp ONTAP tools* > *Mount Datastores*.
. Select the datastores that you want to mount and select *Mount*.
