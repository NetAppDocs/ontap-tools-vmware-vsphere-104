Add new VMware vSphere hosts to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to manage and protect datastores on the hosts.

.Steps

. Add a host to your VMware vSphere cluster following the workflow on page: https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/9-0/use-quickstart-to-add---host-to-a-cluster.html[How to Add an ESX Host to Your vSphere Cluster by Using the Quickstart Workflow]
. After adding the host, go to the ONTAP tools main menu and select *Discover* in the overview panel. Wait for the discovery process to finish. Alternatively, you can wait for the scheduled host discovery to complete.

.Result
The new host is now discovered and managed by ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere. You can proceed to manage the datastore on the new host.
