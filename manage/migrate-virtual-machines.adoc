You should be aware of some of the considerations while migrating existing virtual machines in your data center.

== Migrate protected virtual machines

You can migrate the protected virtual machines to:

* Same vVols datastore in a different ESXi host
* Different compatible vVols datastore in same ESXi host
* Different compatible vVols datastore in a different ESXi host

If the virtual machine is migrated to a different FlexVol volume, then the respective metadata file also gets updated with the virtual machine information. If a virtual machine is migrated to a different ESXi host but same storage, then underlying FlexVol volume metadata file will not be modified.

== Clone protected virtual machines

You can clone protected virtual machines to the following:

* Same container of same FlexVol volume using replication group
+
Same FlexVol volume's metadata file is updated with the cloned virtual machine details.

* Same container of a different FlexVol volume using replication group
+
The FlexVol volume where the cloned virtual machine is placed, the metadata file gets updated with the cloned virtual machine details.

* Different container or vVols datastore
+
The FlexVol volume where the cloned virtual machine is placed, the metadata file gets updated virtual machine details.

VMware presently does not support virtual machines cloned to a VM template.

Clone-of-Clone of a protected virtual machine is supported.

Refer to https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/7-0/vsphere-virtual-machine-administration-guide-7-0/deploying-virtual-machinesvm-admin/clone-an-existing-virtual-machine-h5vm-admin.html[Creating a Virtual Machine for Cloning] for more details.

// 10.3 updates

== Virtual Machine Snapshots

Presently only virtual machine Snapshots without memory are supported. If virtual machine has Snapshot with memory, then the virtual machine is not considered for protection.

You also cannot protect unprotected virtual machines that have memory Snapshot. For this release, you are expected to delete memory snapshot before enabling protection for the virtual machine.

For windows VM with ASA r2 storage type, when you take a snapshot of the virtual machine, it will be a read-only snapshot.
When there is power on call for the VM, the VASA Provider creates a LUN using the read-only snapshot and then it enables it for IOPS. During the power-off request, VASA Provider deletes the LUN that was created and then disables the IOPS.
