Remove storage from datastore action is supported on all ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere discovered or managed vVols datastores in the vCenter Server. This action allows the removal of volumes from the vVols datastores.

The remove option is disabled when there are vVols residing on a particular volume. In addition to removing volumes from datastore, you can delete the selected volume on ONTAP storage.

Delete datastore task from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere in the vCenter Server does the following: 

* Unmounts the vVol container.
* Cleans up igroup. If igroup is not in use, removes iqn from igroup. 
* Deletes Vvol container.
* Leaves the Flex volumes on the storage array. 

Follow the steps below to delete NFS, VMFS, or vVOL datastore from ONTAP tools from the vCenter Server:

.Steps

. Log in to the vSphere client.
. Right-click a host system or a host cluster or a data center and select *NetApp ONTAP tools* > *Delete datastore*.
+
[NOTE]
You cannot delete the datastores if there are virtual machines using that datastore. You need to move the virtual machines to a different datastore before deleting the datastore. You cannot select Volume delete checkbox if the datastore belongs to a protected host cluster.

.. In the case of NFS or VMFS datastore a dialog box appears with the list of VMs that are using the datastore.
.. If the VMFS datastore is created on ASA r2 systems and if it is part of the protection, you need to unprotect the datastore before deleting it.
// 10.3 updates for ASA r2
.. In the case of vVols datastores, delete datastore action deletes the datastore only when there are no vVols associated with it. The Delete datastore dialog box provides an option to delete volumes from ONTAP cluster.
.. In case of ASA r2 systems based vVols datastores, the checkbox to delete the backing volumes is not applicable.
. To delete the backing volumes on ONTAP storage, select *Delete volumes on ONTAP cluster*.
+
[NOTE]
You cannot delete the volume on ONTAP cluster for a VMFS datastore that is part of the protected host cluster.
