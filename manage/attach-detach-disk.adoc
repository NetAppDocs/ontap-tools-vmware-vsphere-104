== Attach a data disk to a virtual machine
Attach a data disk to a virtual machine to expand the storage capacity. 

.Steps

. Log in to the vSphere client.
. Right-click a virtual machine in the inventory and select *Edit Settings*.
. On the *Virtual Hardware* tab, select *Existing hard disk*.
. Select the virtual machine where the disk exists.
. Select the disk you want to attach and select *OK*

.Result
The hard disk appears in the Virtual Hardware devices list.

== Detach a data disk from the virtual machine

You can detach a data disk attached to a virtual machine when it is no longer needed. When you detach the disk from the virtual machine, it is not automatically deleted; it remains on the ONTAP storage system.

.Steps

. Log in to the vSphere client.
. Right-click a virtual machine in the inventory and select *Edit Settings*.
. Move your pointer over the disk and select *Remove*.
[NOTE]
The disk is removed from the virtual machine. If other virtual machines share the disk, the disk files aren't deleted.
