summary: 'After deleting ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere deployment, you should clean up the FlexVolumes created during the deployment. If you have used a dedicated ONTAP cluster for deployments, you should clean up the FlexVolumes because the deployment creates lot of FlexVolumes which are unused resulting in lowered performance.'

When you use a dedicated ONTAP cluster for ONTAP tools for VMware deployment, it creates many unused FlexVol volumes. After removing ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, you should remove the FlexVol volumes to avoid possible performance impacts.

.Steps

. Determine the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere deployment type from the first node VM. 
+
_cat /opt/netapp/meta/ansible_vars.yaml | grep -i protocol_
+
If it is an iSCSI deployment, you need to delete igroups as well. 
. Get the list of FlexVol volumes.
+
_kubectl describe persistentvolumes | grep internalName | awk -F'=' '{print $2}'_
. Remove the VMs from the vCenter Server. Refer to https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/8-0/vsphere-virtual-machine-administration-guide-8-0/managing-virtual-machinesvsphere-vm-admin/adding-and-removing-virtual-machinesvsphere-vm-admin.html#GUID-376174FE-F936-4BE4-B8C2-48EED42F110B-en[Remove and reregister VMs and VM templates].
. Delete FlexVol volumes. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/volumes/delete-flexvol-task.html[Delete a FlexVol volume]. In the CLI command to delete a volume, give the exact name of the FlexVol volumes.
. Delete SAN igroups from the ONTAP storage system in case of iSCSI deployment. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-admin/manage-san-initiators-task.html[View and manage SAN initiators and igroups].
