During guest OS restart operation, grub menu displays an option to reset maintenance console user password. 
This option is used to update the maintenance console user password present on the corresponding VM. After the reset password is complete, the VM restarts to set the new password. In HA deployment scenario, after the VM restart, the password is automatically updated on the other two VMs. 

[NOTE]
For ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere HA deployment, you should change the maintenance console user password on the ONTAP tools management node, which is node1.

.Steps

. Log in to your vCenter Server
. Right-click on the VM and select *Power* > *Restart Guest OS* 
During system restart, you get the following screen:

+
You have 5 seconds to choose your option. Press any key to stop the progress and freeze the GRUB menu.
. Select *Reset maintenance user's password* option. The maintenance console opens.
. In the console, enter the new password details. New password and retype new password details should match to successfully reset the password. You have three chances to enter the correct password. The system restarts after successfully entering the new password.
. Press Enter to continue.
The password is updated on the VM.

[NOTE]
The same GRUB menu comes up during power on of the VM as well. However, you should use the reset password option only with *Restart Guest OS* option.
