You can mount a VMware Virtual Volumes (vVols) datastore to one or more additional hosts to provide storage access to additional hosts. You can unmount vVols datastore only through the APIs.
[NOTE]
When you add a new ESXi host using the https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/9-0/use-quickstart-to-add---host-to-a-cluster.html[Add an ESX Host to Your vSphere Cluster workflow], wait for the scheduled host discovery to complete before it shows up in ONTAP tools. Alternatively, you can manually run discovery from the NetApp ONTAP tools overview screen.

.Steps

. From the vSphere Client home page, select *Hosts and Clusters*.
. In the navigation pane, select the data center that contains the datastore.
. Right-click the datastore and select *NetApp ONTAP tools* > *Mount datastore*.
. In the *Mount datastores on Hosts* dialog box, select the hosts on which you want to mount the datastore, and then select *Mount*.

You can track the progress in the recent task panel.
